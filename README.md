AI is already improving **automation and operational visibility** 🚀  

# Day 2 — Prompt Engineering in Action ✨

On **Day 2** of my **10-day AI + DevOps challenge**, I focused on **Prompt Engineering** to accelerate DevOps automation.  

🔑 **Focus areas:**  
- 🧠 Zero-shot, few-shot, multi-shot, and chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting  
- 🏗 Structured prompts tailored for DevOps workflows  

💡 **Outcome:**  
- ✅ Generated **Regex patterns** for log filtering  
- ✅ Created **Bash snippets** for log automation  
- ✅ Built **Terraform templates** for quick infra setup  

Prompt design isn’t theory — it’s a **practical DevOps skill**. Done right, it makes workflows **faster, smarter, and more reliable** 🚀

# Day 3 — Running LLMs Locally & Making API Calls ⚡🤖

On **Day 3** of my **10-day AI + DevOps challenge**, I explored how to **run LLMs locally** and **call AI via APIs** to automate DevOps workflows.

🔑 **Focus Areas**
- 🖥 Running LLMs locally: **Ollama, LM Studio, GPT4All**  
- 🌐 Calling AI via APIs: **OpenAI, Mistral, LLaMA, DeepSeek, etc.**  
- 🐍 Writing **Python scripts** to invoke the Ollama API  

🛠 **Hands-on Achievements**
- ✅ Built a **Dockerfile Generator** using the **Llama3 model via Ollama API** to auto-generate Docker manifests 🚀  

⚡ **Mini-Challenge**
- Auto-generated **Kubernetes manifests** using an AI API with Llama3 — speeding up infrastructure setup and reducing manual effort  

💡 **Key Takeaway**
Running LLMs locally gives DevOps engineers **control, cost savings, and flexibility**, while API calls unlock **powerful automation workflows**.

# Day 4 — Automating AWS VPC Creation with Bash 🖥️☁️  

On **Day 4** of my **10-day AI + DevOps challenge**, I automated AWS networking setup using a **Bash script**.  

🔑 **Focus areas:**  
- ✅ Verifying AWS CLI installation (cross-platform: Windows, Linux, macOS)  
- ✅ Checking AWS CLI configuration before resource creation  
- 🌐 Automating **VPC creation** with CIDR block  
- 📍 Creating a **public subnet** in a specific availability zone  
- 🏷️ Tagging resources for better identification  

💡 **Outcome:**  
This script **automates AWS networking setup** with just one command, ensuring checks for **CLI installation** and **configuration** before provisioning resources.  


# Day 6 — AIOps: AI for IT Operations ⚙️🤖

On Day 6 of my **10-day AI + DevOps challenge**, I explored how **AIOps (AI for IT Operations)** can help detect anomalies and predict failures from system logs.

📌 **Topics Covered**
- Recap of AIOps and its importance
- AI-powered log analysis
- Anomaly detection using Python & ML
- Predicting server/app failures from logs

🛠 **Hands-on Demos**
- **AI-driven Anomaly Detection:** Used machine learning to identify unusual patterns in logs automatically.
- **Rule-based Error Spike Detection:** Monitored logs for sudden spikes in errors and triggered alerts.

 💡 **Outcome**
- Built workflows to **detect unusual patterns in logs** proactively.
- Learned how AI can **predict server/application failures** before they escalate.
- Combined ML-based detection with rule-based thresholds for **robust monitoring**.

AIOps demonstrates how AI can **enhance IT operations**, reduce manual monitoring, and enable proactive responses.
