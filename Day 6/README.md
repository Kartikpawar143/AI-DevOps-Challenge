# Day 6 — AIOps: AI for IT Operations ⚙️🤖

On Day 6 of my **10-day AI + DevOps challenge**, I explored how **AIOps (AI for IT Operations)** can help detect anomalies and predict failures from system logs.

## 📌 Topics Covered
- Recap of AIOps and its importance
- AI-powered log analysis
- Anomaly detection using Python & ML
- Predicting server/app failures from logs

## 🛠 Hands-on Demos
- **AI-driven Anomaly Detection:** Used machine learning to identify unusual patterns in logs automatically.
- **Rule-based Error Spike Detection:** Monitored logs for sudden spikes in errors and triggered alerts.

## 💡 Outcome
- Built workflows to **detect unusual patterns in logs** proactively.
- Learned how AI can **predict server/application failures** before they escalate.
- Combined ML-based detection with rule-based thresholds for **robust monitoring**.

AIOps demonstrates how AI can **enhance IT operations**, reduce manual monitoring, and enable proactive responses.
